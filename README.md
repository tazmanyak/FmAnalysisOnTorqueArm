##Finite Element Analysis On Torque arm in MATLAB

The main purpose of this project is to establish 2D Finite Element formulation on the torque arm â€“ an automobile component to obtain the location and magnitude of maximum von Mises stress, and the magnitude of maximum vertical and horizontal displacements the arm experiences under the specified loading condition. It is also required that finer mesh should be satisfied so that better approximation can be achieved
